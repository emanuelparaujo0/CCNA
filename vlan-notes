What is a LAN?
A LAN is a group of devices (pcs, servers, router, switches, etc.) in a sigle location (home, office, etc.)

A more specific definition: A LAN is a single broadcast domain, including all devices in that broadcast domain.

A broadcast domain is the group of devices which will receive a broadcast frame (destination MAC FFFF.FFFF.FFFF)
sent by any one of the members.

What is a VLAN?
 VLAN tackles the questions of:
  - Security: Even within the same office, you want to limit who has access to what.
  - Performance: Lots of unnecessary broadcast traffic can reduce network performance.

A switch WILL NOT forward traffic between VLANs, including broadcast/unknown unicast traffic.

The switch does not perform inter-VLAN routing.
It must send the traffic through the router.

VLANs are configured on switches on a per-interface basis.
They logically separate end hosts at layer 2.

VLAN configuration
show vlan brief -> Shows which vlans exist on the switch by default (1, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005 - these vlans can not
be deleted) and shows any other created VLANs.
All interfaces are in vlan1 by default

interface range g1/0 - 3
switchport mode access -> An access port is a switchport which belongs to a single VLAN, and usually connects to end hosts like PCs.
switchport access vlan 10 -> assigns vlan 10 to the interface.

Access because it gives the pcs access to the network 
switchport mode trunk -> Switchports which carry multiple VLANs are called 'trunk ports'.

To change the name of a VLAN
(config)#vlan 10 -> This command creates a VLAN manually as well.
(config-vlan)#name ENGINEERING
